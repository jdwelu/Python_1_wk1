This assignment was a simple program to convert feet to yards. It was intended to help with the concept of the next assignment.

# WeluLab1B
This is a program that will take the cost of an item and make change from the amount of money used to purchase the item.
It also tells the user each denomiation of currency and how many of to give back to the purchaser of the item.
The program, while simple and non-looping, proved to be challenging because I had to switch between int and float variable types.
The program could probably be rewritten, but will stay as is, to as an example of my early problem solving ability.
